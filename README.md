### Getting and cleaning the data 
This file describes about the list of files and its functionality in the working directory.
          There has been an Experiment carried out between 3o volunteers  within the age of 19-48 and they performed the following 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. By using this experiment a bunch of data has been collected and they can be downloaded from the link "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip " .This Zip file contains the Training and test data sets, these data sets are later merged. Merged Dataset will be containing more data and we will be finding the mean of each and every activity and the subject by preparing a tidy data set.
* First download all the files from the link which mentioned above, place all the files in one folder and set the working directory as the same.
* run_analysis.R-->this file will  will merge the training and test data  together to form a tidy data set which will show the average of each activity with respect to subject in all the features.  
* code  book is a file which describes about all the vairables in the dataset. It explains about the variables whcih are used in cleaning up the data.
* The code book helps to identify  the variables in the tidy data which will be created after running the  run_analysis.R file.
